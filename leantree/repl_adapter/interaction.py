    Runs in the *child* between fork() and execve() so the limits apply to the
    Lean subprocess (and propagate via execve to its lake/lean grandchildren).

    - ``RLIMIT_AS = max_memory_bytes`` (when set): a runaway tactic that blows past this gets SIGKILLed cleanly by the kernel; the parent sees EOF on the
      REPL pipes and surfaces a normal ``LeanProcessException``.  Without this, a single bad tactic can grow to 100+ GB and OOM-kill the whole leanserver
      Python process (observed in production).
    - ``prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, SIGKILL)``: when the parent process exits for any reason (including SIGKILL by the OOM killer), the kernel
      immediately sends SIGKILL to this child.  Eliminates orphaned lake/repl-processes.
    - ``setsid()``: put the child (and everything it forks: lake -> repl ->
      lean threads) into a fresh process group whose PGID equals this child's
      PID.  Without this, ``self._proc.kill()`` only SIGKILLs the immediate
      ``lake`` child; its ``repl`` grandchild survives, gets reparented to
      init, and keeps grinding on the last tactic forever.  Observed in
      production: a single orphaned repl with 101 threads burning ~5000% CPU
      and 60+ hours of cumulative CPU time after the lake parent died.  With
      setsid in place, ``os.killpg(proc.pid, SIGKILL)`` reaches every

                     ``None`` means no limit.

        Implementation note - timeout is enforced by SIGKILL-on-deadline,
        not ``asyncio.wait_for``.  Cancelling a task that's parked inside
        ``StreamReader.readline()`` does NOT reliably reset the reader's
        internal ``_waiter`` (CPython issue 30289).  In practice this means
        a single timed-out read corrupts the stream so that the next read
        on the same process raises
        ``RuntimeError: readuntil() called while another coroutine is
        already waiting for incoming data``.  When that propagates out of
        a leanserver request handler it deadlocks the asyncio event loop,
        and the whole leanserver eventually stops answering HTTP.

        Kill-on-deadline runs in the module-level watchdog thread, NOT in
        a per-call ``loop.call_later``.  The old per-call timer was armed
        and cancelled inside this coroutine, so a coroutine cancelled
        before its ``await`` resumed (CancelledError, request hangup,
        outer ``_run_async_op`` timing out) cancelled the timer in
        ``finally`` and left the REPL grinding with no watchdog.  The
        thread-based watchdog is independent of this coroutine's
        lifetime.  ``readline()`` sees EOF when the watchdog kills, the
        inner loop converts that to ``LeanProcessException``, and the
        post-read deadline check below re-tags it as a timeout.
