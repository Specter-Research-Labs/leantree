"""Verify that LeanServer handler threads never wait forever on a stuck
event loop.

Before the fix, every ``_run_async(coro)`` call in server.py passed
``timeout=None`` and so the HTTP handler thread would block on
``future.result()`` indefinitely if any coroutine on the loop didn't
complete.  That was the architectural root cause of the "leanserver
looks alive but /status hangs" failure mode - one stuck coro froze every
handler behind it.

These tests exercise the fix by blocking the event loop *on purpose*
(via ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe`` + ``time.sleep`` on the loop thread,
which really parks the loop - not just an async sleep that yields) and
asserting that handler threads still return promptly with HTTP 503.
